The final project was a fantastic learning experience. I really enjoyed working on the game and diving into the creative side of programming. It taught me a lot about Python, such as how to use the idea of divide and conquer to split the overall process into individual functions to implement this game, work with conditional statements, and utilize loops effectively.

What I liked most about the project was the creative freedom it allowed. Developing a game enabled me to unleash my imagination and think beyond the confines of traditional programming tasks. It was a refreshing change that broadened my perspective on the potential applications of programming.

One thing I struggled with was error checking. It was challenging, but it's something I'm looking forward to improving in the future. This project has opened my eyes to the importance of user experience in programming, and I'm excited to see how this newfound perspective will shape my goals and aspirations as a programmer moving forward.
